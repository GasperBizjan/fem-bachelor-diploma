 Please expand modes (MXPAND command) if any downstream MODAL analysis   
 based calculations (ex: mode superposition analysis, normalizing modes  
 to unity) need to be performed.

 The eigenvalue extraction method must be specified on the MODOPT        
 command.  Either the LANB, LANPCG, or SNODE method is usually           
 recommended.
